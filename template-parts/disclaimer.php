<p>Please be advised that Developers are prohibited by law to do any business (including advertising or informational websites) in any state in which prior registration is required if they are not registered in that state. This can obviously be problematic with webpages, as potential Buyers across the world can access your advertising and marketing webpage. In light of this, we have some recommended disclosures for condominium websites. The disclosure we recommend below does not wholly limit your liability exposure to this problem, as potential Buyers in other states may still gain access to your website. However, in an attempt to reduce your exposure here, we recommend that the following disclosure appear on each website page: <b>“THIS INFORMATIONAL WEBSITE AND ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS PROVIDED HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN OFFERING TO RESIDENTS IN ANY JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA. VOID WHERE PRIOR REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW.”</b>   Additionally, below are some additional steps we recommend for consideration to avoid Buyer’s outside of Florida accessing the site:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Limit the interactive nature of the site by avoiding anywhere potential Buyer’s would enter personal information and do not include an “information request page”. The more interactive the website for potential Buyer’s to access or give information, the more a court would view this as an out of state offer.</li>
	<li>Include a home page where any prospective Buyer must first read the above disclosure, and agree that they are located in Florida by hitting a required linked button of “I agree” or “I do not agree”. The “I agree” click box must be selected by the prospective buyer in order to proceed to the webpage.</li>
	<li>Additionally, if you receive any emails or phone calls from Buyers requesting additional information, you will need to first ask their location and let them know that information can only be provided within the state of Florida. It is not uncommon for out of state regulatory authorities to request information to catch violators of out of state offerings.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we recommend you consider adding a disclosure similar to the following <em><u>on any website pages which depict artist renderings of Units or amenities or provide a general description or depiction of the project:</u></em></p>
